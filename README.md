# NAME

Log::Any::Adapter::JSON - One-line JSON logging of arbitrary structured data

# SYNOPSIS

Get a logger and specify the output destination:

    use Log::Any '$log';
    use Log::Any::Adapter ('JSON', '/path/to/file.log');

    # or

    use Log::Any '$log';
    use Log::Any::Adapter;

    my $handle = ...; # FH, pipe, etc

    Log::Any::Adapter->set('JSON', $handle);

Log some data:

    $log->info('Hello, world');
    $log->info('Hello, %s', $name);
    $log->debug('Blabla', { tracking_id => 42 });
    $log->debug('Blorgle', { foo => 'bar' }, [qw/a b c/], 'last thing');

# DESCRIPTION

This [Log::Any](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAny) adapter logs formatted messages and arbitrary structured
data in a single line of JSON per entry. You must pass a filename or an open
handle to which the entries will be printed.

Optionally you may pass an `encoding` argument which will be used to apply
a `binmode` layer to the output handle. The default encoding is `UTF-8`.

# OUTPUT

## Logged data fields

The adapter expects a string and an optional list `@items`.

If the string has no formatting tokens, it is included in the log
entry in the `message` field as-is.

If the string has formatting tokens, `@items` is checked to verify
that the next `N` values are scalars, where `N` is the number of
tokens in the string. If the number is the same, the string and
tokens are combined using `sprintf()` and the resulting string is
included in the log entry in the `message` field. If the token
and value counts don't match, the adapter croaks.

After the format processing, the remainder of the `items` array is
processed. It may hold arrayrefs, which are included in a top-
level key named `list_data`; additional scalars, which are pushed
into the `additional_messages` key; and hashrefs. The first hashref
encountered has its keys promoted to top-level keys in the log entry,
while additional hashrefs are included in a top-level key named
`hash_data`.

## Other fields

In addition, the log entry will have the following fields:

- `time`
- `level`
- `category`

# EXAMPLES

## Plain text message

    $log->debug('a simple message');

Output is a **single string** with JSON like:

    {
      "category":"main",
      "level":"debug",
      "message":"hello, world",
      "time":"2021-03-03T17:23:25.73124"
    }

## Formatted message

    my $val = "string";
    my $num = 2;

    $log->debug('a formatted %s with %d tokens', $val, $num);

Output is a **single string** with JSON like:

    {
      "category":"main",
      "level":"debug",
      "message":"a formatted string with 2 tokens",
      "time":"2021-03-03T17:23:25.73124"
    }

## Single hashref

The first hashref encountered has its keys elevated to the top level.

    $log->debug('the message', { tracker => 42 });

Output is a **single string** with JSON like:

    {
      "category":"main",
      "level":"debug",
      "message":"the message",
      "time":"2021-03-03T17:23:25.73124",
      "tracker":42
    }

## Additional hashrefs and arrayrefs

    $log->debug('the message', { tracker => 42 }, { foo => 'bar'});

Output is a **single string** with JSON like:

    {
      "category":"main",
      "hash_data":{
        "foo":"bar"
      },
      "level":"debug",
      "message":"the message",
      "time":"2021-03-03T17:23:25.73124",
      "tracker":42
    }

    $log->debug('the message', { tracker => 42 }, {foo => 'bar'}, [1..3]);

Output is a **single string** with JSON like:

    {
      "category":"main",
      "hash_data":[
        {"foo":"bar"}
      ],
      "level":"debug",
      "list_data":[
        [1,2,3]
      ],
      "message":"the message",
      "time":"2021-03-03T17:23:25.73124",
      "tracker":42
  }

## Additional messages

Any scalars that are passed that are not consumed as the values of formatting
tokens will be included in an `additonal_messages` key.

    $log->debug('a simple message', 'foo', 'bar');

Output is a **single string** with JSON like:

{
  "additional\_messages":\[
    'foo',
    'bar'
  \],
  "category":"main",
  "level":"debug",
  "message":"hello, world",
  "time":"2021-03-03T17:23:25.73124"
}
